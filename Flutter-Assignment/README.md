# Basic Flutter Page

This project consists of a basic Flutter application developed for the Pixel 3a API 34. It currently features two pages:
- Home page
- BMI calculator

## Installation & Usage (for Windows)

Ensure Flutter is installed on your machine. Select the device API (if Android Studio is installed) you want to run the app on, then execute the following command: 

```bash
flutter run
```

## About the Page

### Home Page
The Home Page is a simple interface designed to contain various small apps that I plan to build before the deadline. It includes a feature demonstrating state management in Flutter: when you touch the screen, the background color changes to a random color. 

### BMI calculator
The BMI Calculator page allows you to select your preferred unit from the provided options to calculate your BMI. The BMI is calculated using the formula: weight (in kg) / (height (in cm) * height (in cm)). This page incorporates various Flutter concepts such as controllers and state management.
